# Facebook_Automation
Automating posting on multiple groups on facebook using python
All the three files: chromedriver_1.exe, FB_GUI_CODE_1.0.py and GUI_icon.ico need to be in one folder
Steps for using the GUI:
1.) Enter your username and password
2.) Copy the facebook group links where you want to post and paste them in the space provided i.e. "Enter Group Links"
3.) Enter a suitable filename in the space provided i.e. "Enter Filename"
4.) Click on the button "Save Groups", this will create a file of the given filename that will save all your group links for future use
(If you want to post on the same set of group links in future, you can directly select the file containing those group links from the option menu "Select Groups" )
5.) Enter your post text in the space provided i.e. "Enter Post Text"
6.) For adding image click on the button "Browse Files" and select your image file (optional)
7.) At the end click on the "Start Post" button
* Sleep1 and Sleep2 are used for delaying the flow for handling slower network
* Enter 10 for both Sleep1 and Sleep2 for optimum functionality
After the program ends, it will show the names of the facebook groups on which the posting was sucessful in the "LOG" section
